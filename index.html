            The optional temperature sensor is a stand-alone device that transmits <br>
            temperature data (with a period of 12 minutes) at the place of its installation via a wireless communication channel using<br>
            using a secure communication protocol. Also, each such sensor has a unique identifier for error-free detection<br>
            by the clock. The communication range can reach up to 15 meters indoors and up to 30 meters in open areas.<br>
            Three AAA batteries are used as the sensor's power source. The low-power mode<br>
            allows the device to operate from one set of batteries for up to 1 year.<br>
